## Models

## Key Functions of the `models.py` in Django

1. **Define Database Schema:** It defines the structure of the database by specifying the fields, their types, and relationships between different models.

2. **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):** Django's ORM system allows developers to interact with the database using Python objects rather than writing raw SQL queries. Models serve as the bridge between Python code and the database.

3. **Data Validation:** Models include field types and constraints that enforce data integrity and validation rules. This helps ensure that the data stored in the database meets certain criteria.

4. **Relationships:** Models can establish relationships between different entities, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships. This is essential for organizing and linking data.

5. **CRUD Operations:** The models define methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records in the database. These operations can be performed using Django's query API.

6. **Administrative Interface:** Django provides an admin interface that allows developers and administrators to manage and manipulate data in the database easily. Models determine what is displayed and how data is edited in the admin interface.

7. **Form Generation:** Models can be used to automatically generate HTML forms for data entry and validation. This simplifies the process of handling user input and storing it in the database.
